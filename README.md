/* Elevator Pitch */
Energy Storm is a site that can track everything nutrition and excercise in one easy-to-use place. There will no longer be a need to use multiple apps or excel spread sheets to track your progress. Energy Storm has everything you need all in one place. 

/* Key Features */
The "Workouts" menu is the current focus of the site. It allows users to specify workout days and add specific lifts to that day. Users can select non-user-specific workouts from the site database or create their own. If a user selects a workout from the site database, additional information can be found including links to youtube videos, proper technique descriptions, and more. Once a user has a selected workout, they can track their sets and reps for each day. These values will then be compared to previous values to show progress over time. 

The "calories" menu will be a place to track calories consumed that day, set goals, and monitor progress. The main page will show food items eaten that day and the total calories for that day as well as the difference between them. From this page, one can add common food items, select amounts, or even add their own meals. 

/* These two menus ^ are the current goal for the site during this semester */

The "meals" menu allows users to save their favorite meals to the site. Meals will contain nutritional info from a specific amount of a meal. Once a meal is added, it can be added via calories menu to track daily eating. Meals can also be added through the "Menus" menu.

The "Menus" menu will contain a list of non-user-specific menus found in the database. Users can add these to their meals and eventually to their calories page. Users can also create their own menus or even find recipes to add from the internet. Once a desireable menu is found, users can add the necessary ingredients to their shopping list.
